## What This Is

This is a repository dedicated to trivia questions for the PartyFish game suite.

## How to Contribute

1. Add your trivia question to [trivia.json](trivia.json)
2. Run `npm test` to verify the JSON and format the file
3. Open a pull request with your changes

**If you have multiple trivia questions, please create a separate PR for each.** That way we don't have to reject all of them if there's one we don't like.

## Guidelines
Here are some reasons your question might be rejected:
- The question is inappropriate
- The incorrect answers don't make sense
- The question is way too easy or too hard
- The question is a repeat of another question
- The question JSON is formatted incorrectly
